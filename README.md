# What is polyDFE?
polyDFE infers the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations 
from polymorphism, and, if available, divergence data obtained from an 
outgroup. The polymorphism data is given through the unfolded site frequency 
spectrum (SFS). Note that, in order to obtain an unfolded SFS, at least one 
outgroup is needed. However, including the divergence data when inferring 
the DFE can lead to bias in the estimated parameters. 

Once the DFE is obtained, polyDFE also calculates alpha, the rate of adaptive 
molecular evolution.

polyDFEv2.0 can fit jointly multiple datasets for which some parameters can
be set to be invariant (shared across the datasets). This enables model testing 
for parameter invariance, for example, testing if different datasets have the 
same DFE or not.

# Requirements
polyDFE can be ran using the provided pre-compiled binaries for Windows and Linux.

polyDFE is implemented in C and uses the GSL library. For compiling polyDFE, 
the GSL library should be downloaded from https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ and 
compiled accordingly. polyDFE has been tested using GSL-1.16. Note that polyDFE 
does not work with a newer version of GSL.


# How to install polyDFE
The simplest way to compile polyDFE:

1. `cd' to the directory containing the makefile and type
`make all' to compile the code.

1. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source code directory by typing `make clean'.
     
If the GSL library is not installed in the default directory, than the
installation path needs to be specified in the makefile by updating USR_INC and 
USR_LIB and uncommenting the lines at the top of the makefile.
